Hello this a program made by myself and with AI 

The program is still in Update but feel free to try it

So LoL-Coach AI is a program that is python based

The goal was to "replace" I-Tero, PoroTeacher , UGG,..
The biggest flawn in those were the lack of personal feedback and only stat based matchup and not raelly personal
So this program CAN download your games stats , give you feedback , tell your mains , tell your WR , tell your KDA 

BUT also can take in consideration the matchup for in live game (queue and ing) but also adapt your build based on the matchup , your winrate, the synergy with the allies champs and also adapt in real time the choises of items if an ennemy choises are not what ppl usally play

Feel free to give a feedback on this

ALSO if you want to try it you HAD to put your own API RIOT KEY (DONT FORGET THEY EXPIRE EVERY 24h)
https://developer.riotgames.com/
AND delete my stats in the folder (My_champions and my_stats)

FOR THE MOMENT IT KINDA WORK (not a 100% the features i wanted cuz it just recommand BOOTS and ANTI-HEAL) + some stats are broken 

Also if you really want to try it by yourself
this is what you have to do :

- Download Python
-(Maybe download all library)
-Change the Username , Tag and API KEY
-Delete the stats (cuz those are mine)

Run lol-ai-recommander for starting it
Run App.py for the selfhosted web server
